# Prosper-Load-Dataset-Exploratory-and-Explanatory-Analysis
The original dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. Most variables are numeric in nature, but the variables such as CreditGrade, LoanStatus, ProsperRating(Alpha), ListingCategory, Occupation, EmploymentStatus, IncomeRange, and IsBorrowerHomeowner are categorical variables.  The dataset features can be split into three main categories:  Borrowers data Loan data Credit Risk metrics However, since we cannot explore the entire 81 variables, 16 variables of interest were pre-selected and explored. This variables include some of the borrower's information, loan data, and credit risk metric.
